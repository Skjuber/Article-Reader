# Article-Reader

Article-Reader is is a simple and user-friendly frontend application built using React and Sass/SCSS. It is designed to aggregate and display articles in an organized, categorized, and chronological order. You can browse, search, bookmark your favorite articles, and view them by category.

Article-Reader employs the power of the New York Times API to fetch real-time and authentic articles, providing you with a reliable and current newsfeed.

In addition to its features mentioned above, Article-Reader also leverages the capabilities of the browser's Local Storage to enhance the user experience. The application utilizes Local Storage for storing the state of bookmarked articles.

When a user bookmarks an article, the relevant data is saved to the Local Storage, allowing the application to remember the user's preferences even after closing and reopening the browser. This ensures that the bookmarked articles remain accessible and can be easily retrieved by the user whenever needed.
